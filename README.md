## EVERY DAY IS GAME DAY 
Every Day is Game Day is an application to simplify the experience of using Mark Verstegen's excellent workout manual of the same name. It was developed with no assistance or permission my Mark Verstegen or his company, EXOS. 

In order to use the app, you need to sign up for an account, which is stored in the EDiGD backend. Once you're logged in, follow the workouts in order each day. Where there is a value that needs to be stored, such as the amount of weight lifted, enter that information in the field. At the end of the workout, confirm you have completed the workout by clicking "All Done!" 

This is the backend for the Every Day is Game Day workout tracker. The main end point is /api/v1/user_sessions
